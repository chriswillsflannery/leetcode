/*

Implement a function functionLength, to return the number of parameters a function expects. Note that this is a static value defined by the function, not the number of arguments the function is called with (which is determined by arguments.length)

P.S. Practically, there's no need for this function since it is a simple wrapper. However, it is useful to know how to determine the number of parameters a function expects, which is useful for questions like Curry II.

function foo() {}
function bar(a) {}
function baz(a, b) {}

functionLength(foo); // 0
functionLength(bar); // 1
functionLength(baz); // 2

*/

export default function functionLength(fn: Function): number {
  return fn.length;
}
